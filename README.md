I am building this website as a tourist website encouraging travel to Ireland.

<h2>UX</h2>
*Target audiences = tourists and potential tourists.

*To search for destinations that interest the user in Ireland.

*To view the locations of interesting places in Ireland on a map.

*To receive suggestions of places to visit or activities to try in Ireland.

<h3>Strategy Plane</h3> 
<h4>Aims</h4>
A website for tourists to learn more about Ireland and encourage them to visit

<h3>Scope Plane</h3> 
<h4>Features included in design based on information from the strategy 
plane</h4>

Google Places API. 

Search bar for Google Map.

Google Maps

A 'Featured Places' section to showcase 'hidden gems' around Ireland.

Social sharing buttons - for tourists to share with friends and family.



<h3>Structure Plane</h3> 
<h4>Structure of Information</h4>
Interaction Design - I've designed a simple single page webpage.

Information Architecture - The webpage flows from 
searchbar to map and on to recommended places based on the search results. 
The pictures featured on the page are all panoramic shots of Ireland
showcasing the landscapes tourists can see for themselves. 


<h3>Skeleton Plane</h3> 
<h4>How will our information be represented and how will
the user navigate to the information and the features?</h4> 
I decided that I would create a visually striking header that contains changing
backgrounds and a searchbar that is large enough to be clear in purpose but 
suitably small enough to leave those background images to still be shown off.
Scrolling would be used, as necessary, to allow user move further down through
the page when neccessary. 
The Google Maps takes up the majority of it's row due to it's importance to the 
purpose of the webpage.
Interface Design - I have utilised a search bar and a checkbox in the search bar. 
The checkbox allows users to restrict their search to within the bounds of the 
map view.
// Since my site is quite simple I really did not need to do much design 
// here. I just kept in mind
// that my site should have a familiar look similar to other common sites.
Navigation Design - since the project contains a single webpage, the only navigation
required is scrolling. 

<h3>Surface Plane</h3> 
<h4>Finished Product</h4>

The color scheme is consistent between white backgrounds and headers in emerald 
green. 

Font - I used 'Irish-Grover' and 'Permanent Markers' both Google Fonts. I felt Irish Grover was 
the perfect fit for 'Experience Ireland' - as it gives the page a quirky font that
castches the eye.
The logic behind 'Permanent Marker' was similar. 
I felt it was easy to read for the main bodies
of text. 

<h3>User Stories</h3>
As a user, I want search for destinations using a search bar on the homepage.

As a user, I want the map to refocus based on my searches or map location.

As a user, I would like recommendations of places to go based on my searches.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and 
describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Search Bar - allows users to input places they know in Ireland or allow 
autocomplete to help narrow down their searches


Map - map refocuses to area searched for. Map zooms in sufficiently for user after
search to show markers which can be clicked to find out more about each specific
location.

Recommendations - after a specific place search, users will see recommend tourist 
locations for them to visit





<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
Bootstrap library was used to aid development with its grid system
Bootstrap 3.3.7

**jQuery was used to aid the implementation of Bootstrap (e.g. the burger menu) 
and to assist deployment of Fancybox**

Google Fonts has been the source of the 'Irish Grover' and 'Permanent Marker' as I
believe the fonts are both clear suitable for this project 

**I used Font Awesome for the social media icons button in the footer.


<h2>Testing</h2>

I have extensively tested the website on the following physical devices - Mobile - 
HTC Desire, Huawei P20 Lite, Huawei PSmart 2019 and **** while also testing across a number of other
sample devices through Chrome developer tools. 
Tablet - Lenovo Tab 10, Kindle Fire 7, iPad, Samsung Galaxy Tab 10 while also 
testing across a number of other sample devices through Chrome developer tools. 
Laptop/Desktop - Asus L403.
